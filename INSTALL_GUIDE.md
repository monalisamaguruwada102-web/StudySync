# How to Install StudySync

Because this is a private application and not signed by a Certificate Authority (which costs money), Windows may flag it as "Unknown". This is normal.

## Steps to Install

1.  **Locate the Installer**:
    - Look for the file named `StudySync Setup 0.0.0.exe` (version number may vary).
    - It is located in the `dist_electron` folder.

2.  **Run the Installer**:
    - Double-click the `.exe` file.

3.  **Bypass Blue Screen (SmartScreen)**:
    - If you see a blue window saying **"Windows protected your PC"**:
        1.  Click the underlined text **"More info"**.
        2.  Click the button **"Run anyway"**.

4.  **Finish Installation**:
    - Follow the prompts to install the app.
    - It will automatically create a shortcut on your Desktop.

## Troubleshooting

- **Antivirus**: If your antivirus blocks it, you may need to "Allow" the file or disable the antivirus temporarily during installation.
- **Unblock File**: Right-click the `.exe` -> Properties -> Check **"Unblock"** at the bottom (if visible) -> Apply -> OK.
